## Challenge Instructions
This project utilizes D3 techniques to analyze the current trends shaping people's lives, as well as creating charts, graphs, and interactive elements to help readers understand the findings. The data set is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates, including data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. MOE stands for "margin of error."

## D3 Dabbler
A scatter plot was created between two of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty, which represents each state with circle elements.
- The data was imported from data.csv by using the d3.csv function
- Each circle included state abbreviations
- Axes and labels were created and situated to the left and bottom of the chart
